The project has 5 steps:
## Step 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Load the training set from 'train/X_train.txt' and the test set from 'test/X_test.txt'. 
These data sets have 561 columns for 561 feature variables.
The names of these columns/variables are stored in 'features.txt', so we can assign these column names accordingly.
